    <h2>History of Senate and the House of Representatives:</h2>
        <p>
            The current structure of the U.S. Congress, with a bicameral legislature consisting of a Senate and House of Representatives, that was established through the drafting and ratification of the U.S. Constitution in 1787-1788. The Great Compromise was what created both of the Senate and the House of Representative. The Great Compromise was a compromise between  the large states and the small states over how they would be represented in the congress. The large states wanted representation in Congress to be proportional to population, as proposed in the Virginia Plan.
            The small states wanted equal representation for all states, as proposed in the New Jersey Plan. The Great Compromise, was proposed by Roger Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth saying that the House of Representatives would have representation proportional to each state's population, meanwhile the Senate would have equal representation, with two senators per state.
